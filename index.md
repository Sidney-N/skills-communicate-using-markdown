# Apples 101
Apples are a fruit that grows on trees. They can range in taste from sweet to bittersweet to sour and com in a variety of colors

## Grannysmith Apples
These apples are bright green and have a sour taste to them. But I find them to be sweet from time to time.

## Golden Delicious Apples
These apples are a smooth yellow and are just the right amount of sweet.
